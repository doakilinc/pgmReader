 *     About: This file holds the readaline function which accepts pointers to
 *     a file to read from and a char array to store the content of a single 
 *     line. The function returns the number of bytes needed to store the 
 *     characters in a single line.

 *
 * About: reads a single line from the input file and stores its contents to 
 *        datapp
 * Inputs:
 *		FILE *inputfd: pointer to the input file to read the lines from
 *      char **datapp: pointer to pointer to a char array to store the contents
 *      of one line from the file
 * Return: number of bytes used to store one line from the file
 * Notes
 *      will CRE, if either of the supllied arguments is null
 *      may CRE if malloc fails
 *      it's the callers responsibilty to free datapp unless there are no lines
 *      to read
